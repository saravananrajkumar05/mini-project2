French talks about energy, form, mechanism, and economy in natural and man-made things. He compares birds to planes in terms of fuel-capacity, energy conversion efficiency, drag, etc. He compares suspension bridges and dinosaurs.

Harry Wu spent 19 years of his life in prison camps and forced labor camps all over China for crimes no more serious than speaking his mind too openly on a few occasions. He was forced to endure the most humiliating treatment imaginable under terrible conditions including near starvation during China's famines, where the prisoners had it even worse than the normal citizens. If you worry about the thought police, read this book and it will put your worries in perspective -- though certainly not to rest. Now that Wu is again incarcerated in China, where he was trying to gather more information on the forced labor system currently in operation, this book is that much more timely."

Lipovetsky basically argues that modern fashion contributes to democratization by allowing individuals more choices and also by obscuring social classes (Does Bill Gates dress signify his social or financial superiority in any way?). He also gives a pretty concise and coherent history of fashion which helps us understand where we stand today. On top of all that, it's well written. I don't know whether to thank him or Porter for that. All and all, an outstanding and entertaining rejection of the tedious, reductive Marxist explanations of fashion."

Another wonderful Powers' novel is &quot;Last Call&quot; which is set in modern day California and Nevada and tells the story of Buggsie Seagal, Poker, Tarot cards, Las Vegas, and how they all relate to the Fisher King. If you like well thought out novels which draw a huge number of (often strange) bits of fact and fantasy together the novels of Tim Powers will be sure delight you."

It is an excellent source of information, even if one is just interested in learning more about the subject of electric vehicles. Mr Brant's credentials include a degree in engineering, and having worked on the Lunar Rover. He begins his book by exploring the appropriateness of the electric vehicle from an environmental standpoint. He then quickly reviews the history of the EV, from the mid 1800's to the present. He does a good job of surveying the current (as of late 1993) crop of electic vehicle producers, as well as the plans of the major auto makers for electrics. Brant devots a chapter to the options available to the person who wants to own an electric vehicle today: Buy a ready to run car from a manufacturer or converter, have one built or converted for you, or do the conversion yourself. One option that he seems to largely discount is the option of buying a used EV. Although such vehicles can be somewhat hard to find, especially away from large cities on the coasts, they can put a person into an EV for much less money and work than any other alternative. As you might expect from the book's title Brant favors the self-conversion option. He compares the various types of motor vehicles as conversion options; passenger cars, vans, and small pickup trucks. His conclusion, that a small pickup truck might be the easiest to convert, while giving the best range, seems a valid one, as long as a small pickup meets your needs, and suits your style. Chapter 5 is an excellent reference listing suppliers, EV clubs, and various converters and manufacturers. With Chapter 6 Brant begins the real meat of the book. He presents formulae and charts that allow you predict the performance of the vehicle you choose for conversion, and pick the size of motor and batteries that you will need. The next chapters are devoted to each of the unique systems of an EVin some detail: Electric motors, controllers, batteries, and chargers. To this reviewer, these chapters are the most valuable, and make this book useful to anyone with an interest in Electric Vehicles. The current state of the art is reviewed for each of these systems in some detail and with an eye toward practical maintanence and selection, and upcoming technology is also covered. Surprisingly, only one chapter of the book covers the actual conversion process. Although there is probably enough detail here for the experienced home mechanic or mechanically inclined individual, someone who has never pulled an engine out of a car, or done other major repairs on his own, will probably need more help; especially if his conversion is not of a small pickup truck. All-in-all there is a lot of good information in this book, and it is a vital addition to the library of any would-be electric vehicle converter, owner or pipe dreamer.."

First, Barton's book was written prior to the time when deconstruction became a trendy approach to scripture. Thus, students should be aware the structuralism has transformed into another approach more suited for the nihilistic climate of our age. Second, for those of us who believe that God is speaking to us through his word, Barton leaves little hope.

The illustrations, trivia, and overall production quality of this book make it far superior to the older books available on the same topic. Eye-popping cover and fair price ($9.95) make it a great gift for any golfer. I highly recommend this book"

You'll learn about every aspect of riding, from selecting equipment to touring to riding in traffic. Find out what kind of accidents really happen to cyclists, so you can learn how to avoid that sort of accident, and stop worrying about accidents that almost never happen. (Like being hit from behind.) <br />Forester is one of the world's foremost experts in traffic cycling, and he designed the *Effective Cycling* program which is taught by the League of American Bicyclists. A similar program is the Can-Bike Skills program of the Canadian Cycling Association. Both courses teach traffic cycling skills and use *Effective Cycling* as the text. <br />I consider the &quot;riding in traffic&quot; chapters to be most important. You'll learn where to be on the road (which lane? how far from the curb?) and where to be within your lane (right? middle? left?) - all of which depends on what sort of road you're riding on. You'll learn how to change lanes properly in any traffic condition, how to gain cooperation from motorists, how to prevent acccidents from happening to you, and how to avoid an accident that's coming your way by using emergency maneuvers. <br />If you are going to buy only one cycling book, *Effective Cycling* should certainly be the one. While you're at it, buy a gift copy for every cyclist you love. <br />Forester's *Effective Cycling* techniques work. I ride in busy city traffic every day and it's easy and fun. This I owe in large part to *Effective Cycling*."

Full of believable and captivating characters, These Old Shades will take you body and soul to a time and place long past, if indeed it ever existed. The Duc of Avon is the male lead; he is an unrepentant reprobate whose basic good nature has not quite entirely withered away. He adpots a street waif in Paris, playing along with the charade that the child is a boy. His motives are not of the best, at first, but as the story unfolds, we are allowed to watch a subtle shift in the thrust of his plans. The two main characters are supported by a rich cast of characters, from the household servants to the pinnacle of Paris society. The Duc's bubble-headed sister is not as much of a lightweight as she would have you believe, and his younger brother is just a simple, nice fellow. The biggest appeal of this book, for this reviewer at any rate, is the language-of-the-day, with which Ms. Heyer brings these people and this era to brilliant clarity."
