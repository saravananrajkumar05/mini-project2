Problem Statement  :
    
        You are tasked with analyzing customer reviews for Amazon products. The dataset contains over 150 million customer reviews in a Parquet format, including details like product information, review ratings, helpful votes, customer information, and review text. The goal is to clean the data, load it into a remote SQL database (such as AWS RDS, TiDB, or any other online SQL service), and then run various SQL-based analytical queries to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.
